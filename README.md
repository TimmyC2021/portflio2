# portfolio2

So what happened to the original portfolio?

The first version was started very early on in the course at nology. At the time we only had some
elementary HTML, SCSS and JavaScript skills. It didn't look great.

Portfolio2 has been written using React as it's core. Hopefully it is more pleasing to look at 
as well as being more responsive for viewing on mobile devices.
